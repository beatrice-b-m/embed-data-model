class ImagingInterpretation:
    """Assessment and recommendation documented for one finding.

    The interpretation is stored on its Finding and does not repeat the
    finding's identity. It is mutable so the loader can refresh it in place,
    keeping a consumer's reference and extra attributes.

    Attributes
    ----------
    assessment : Code or None, optional
        Reported BI-RADS assessment with its meaning; None means missing and
        no category is inferred. Text is accepted as a code without meaning.
    recommendation : Code or None, optional
        Reported recommendation, possibly several comma-separated codes, with
        their meanings. Default None.
    sources : tuple of SourceRef, optional
        Distinct source rows supporting the interpretation. Default ().

    Notes
    -----
    An assessment or recommendation is never a tissue diagnosis.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> from embed_data_model import Code
    >>> ImagingInterpretation(assessment=Code("S", "Suspicious")).assessment.meaning
    'Suspicious'
