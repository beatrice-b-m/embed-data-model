# Changelog

## Unreleased

### Added

- Exam fields `density` (`tissueden`), `exam_type` (`mg_exam_type`),
  `visit_type` (`vtype`), `modality` (`modality_desc`) and `patient_age`
  (`age_at_study_anon`), loaded by default. `validate` flags a patient age
  outside 1-89 (EMBED top-codes ages at 89; zero is a data-quality error).
- Patient `race` and `ethnicity`, recorded per exam context like `sex`.
- Finding descriptors from the MagView mass, asymmetry, architectural
  distortion, calcification, other-finding and implant columns, stored in
  `finding.descriptors` as source codes under semantic names. Each descriptor
  follows refresh and merge on its own. Comma-separated codes are kept whole.
  The unbound free-form `descriptors` binding is removed.

### Removed

- `core.birads` and its lexicon normalizers. They were never used by the loader
  and accept only English BI-RADS terms such as "oval", while EMBED stores
  source codes such as "O" in columns that mix finding kinds. EMBED finding
  descriptors are now loaded as their source codes (see Added).
- Graph internals exposed as API: `reference`, `remove_reference`,
  `clear_references`, `operation_counts`, `issues`, `identity_namespace`, and
  the `core.selection.select`/`partition` functions (use the graph methods).
- Aliases and duplicate methods: `pathologies`, `registry_pathology`,
  `finding_index`, `finding_id`, `extend_findings`, `set_linked_exam`,
  `set_registry_entry`, `add_linked_accession`, `add_registry_reference`,
  `Finding.merge_observation`, `Selection.owning`.
- `ExamAttributeObservation` and `Exam.attribute_observations`: exam fields are
  invariant across rows and were never loaded as observations.
- `PathologyDiagnosis`, an intermediate object the adapter copied field by
  field into `Pathology`. `normalize_pathology` returns a dictionary of
  supplied `Pathology` fields plus the descriptor slots.
- `docs/qualification.md`, a dated record of one local test run whose counts
  and commit hashes went stale with the next change. CI records test results.
- `load_embed` parameters `retain_raw` (validated but never used),
  `registry_rows` (an alias of `registry`) and `identity_namespace` (a label
  that changed nothing).
- The `core.provenance` module (`SourceLocator`, `BuildIssue`,
  `SourceOccurrence`, `ResolutionState`, `AvailabilityState`,
  `SourceScopeKind` and a duplicate `IssueSeverity`). The loader only ever
  produced `SourceRef`, which is now the single source-row type; each class
  validates it through `core.source.optional_source`.
  `ImagingInterpretation` drops its availability fields and its separate
  `source` constructor argument; pass `sources`.
- Unused association and attribution types that the library never produced:
  the `clinical.associations` module (`AttributionStatus`,
  `ClinicalObjectReference`, `FindingProcedureLink`, `AssociationLink`),
  `PathologyReference`, `PathologyAttributionLink`, `PathologyRecordKind` and
  `UnresolvedProcedureOccurrence`. Relationships are represented by the graph
  and unresolved records keep their source payload.

### Changed

- Relationships are stored as keys on the entities and resolved by
  `DatasetGraph` indexes. A finding stores its exam's accession, a procedure the
  keys of its findings and exams (`finding_references`, `exam_references`),
  pathology the keys of its procedures, findings and exams, and an exam its
  owner, links and registry assignments. Relationships form in any arrival
  order, collections are resolved on access, and a changed key is propagated to
  every entity that stored it.
- Adding a child to an entity without a graph registers both in a new graph.
  The standalone-tree rekey is gone; rekeying always goes through a graph.
- `graph.pop(entity)` returns the entity inside a new graph that holds what it
  contains, instead of a graph-less tree. `register` and `pop` no longer take a
  `boundary` argument.
- Assigning a key or reference field of a registered entity goes through the
  graph instead of raising `AttributeError`.
- `Exam.breast_sides` is computed on access, so it always matches finding and
  image laterality. `BreastSide` is a frozen view and `Exam.ensure_side` is
  removed.
- Partition context is reported by `graph.is_context(entity)` instead of a
  `context` attribute on copies. Copies keep the keys they stored, so
  relationships to entities outside a group stay unresolved references.
- `to_dict()` exports one entity's fields, with related entities as keys,
  instead of nesting its descendants.
- Constructors no longer accept child collections (`Patient(exams=...)`,
  `Exam(findings=..., images=..., procedures=..., pathology=...,
  registry_pathology=..., breast_sides=...)`, `Finding(procedures=...)`,
  `Procedure(pathologies=...)`, `MammogramImage(rois=...)`); use the `add_*`
  methods.
- `PathologyObservation` is a frozen value `(descriptor, source_slot,
  source_ordinal, source)`.
- `ImagingInterpretation(assessment=None, recommendation=None, sources=())` is
  a mutable value stored on its finding; it no longer takes or repeats
  `accession_number` and `finding_number`.
- Patient history observations and `HistoryTimeEstimate` are values stored
  on their `Patient` and no longer carry `patient_id`; construct them without
  it. Observations stay mutable through `update`, which re-checks fields.
  `HistoryTimeEstimate` is frozen. The history normalizers no longer take a
  `patient_id` argument.
- `ImageLandmark` is a frozen value `(y, x, landmark_type, confidence,
  source)` that no longer repeats its image's ID. Change one with
  `dataclasses.replace`. `ImageLandmark.owned_by`, the `image_id` and
  `provenance` fields, and `MammogramImage.with_landmark` (a shallow copy that
  shared mutable state) are removed.
- `PathologySeverity` members carry their EMBED meanings
  (`INVASIVE_BREAST_CANCER`=0 through `NON_BREAST_CANCER`=5) instead of
  `SEVERITY_0`–`SEVERITY_5`. The docstring records the inverse ordering and
  that code 5 is non-breast cancer.
- Patient attributes are recorded per exam context as
  `PatientAttributeObservation(attribute, value, accession_number,
  context_date)`. `Patient.attribute_as_of` and `Patient.attribute_history`
  choose values explicitly. `patient.sex` keeps a value only when all
  observations agree. Values that differ between exams are no longer reported
  as conflicts or discarded. `Patient.context_date` and the unused
  `select_patient_attribute_as_of` selection types are removed.
- `Pathology(...)` requires an explicit `identity` or both `patient_id` and
  `record_id`. The undocumented `**identity_parts` attachment/report-date
  fallback, which could not be reached through the constructor, is removed.
- Refresh replaces only fields whose columns the rows supply. An explicit null
  still clears a field, but a column absent from every row now leaves it
  unchanged. Previously a findings-only MagView load cleared the exam date,
  exam description and patient sex loaded earlier.
- Default column bindings now name only columns that exist in the internal
  EMBED tables. `patients.birth_year`, `images.series_instance_uid` and
  pathology `diagnosis`, `result_category` and `malignant` are unbound by
  default; bind them through `columns` if a source provides them.

### Fixed

- A prior-procedure history result of `NONE` loads as `"no_reported_result"`
  instead of None, so it stays distinct from a blank result. `NONE` means no
  result was reported; it is not a negative result.
- Pathology on MagView procedure rows is keyed by its procedure and attaches to
  it. It was keyed on the provisional pathology report date (`pdate_anon`), so
  pathology without that date became an unresolved record even when its
  procedure was fully identified. The report date is now only an attribute.
- A refresh that supplies a corrected patient ID for an exam now replaces its
  source claims. Previously claims only accumulated, so a corrected row left
  the exam permanently unowned. Merge still adds claims.
  `DatasetGraph.set_patient_claims` replaces an exam's claims directly.
- `mode="merge"` now detects values that contradict a populated value already
  in the graph. The field becomes unknown and the load reports
  `conflicting_<grain>_<field>`. Previously a later merge silently overwrote
  the earlier value, and only conflicts within one call were detected.
- A supplied null finding `side` now loads as bilateral and projects to both
  breast sides, matching the EMBED MagView convention. It previously loaded as
  unknown and the finding appeared on neither side.
- Coded values (assessment, recommendation, procedure type, pathology
  descriptors) are trimmed and uppercased before comparison, so formatting
  variants of one code no longer register as conflicting values. Procedure
  identities and descriptors now carry the normalized code.
- A negative finding `distance` (EMBED uses values such as -2 and -99 as
  undocumented exceptional codes) is no longer stored as a distance from the
  nipple. The raw code stays in `source_distance_codes` and the load reports
  `exceptional_finding_distance`. `validate` flags a negative or non-finite
  distance supplied directly.
- `ImagesInAcquisition` is loaded as `frame_count` only for DBT images; on other
  image types it is not a frame count. `validate` no longer rejects every DBT
  image with a frame count (it compared against the wrong modality value), and
  multiple frames on a non-DBT image is now a warning instead of an error.
- Image `height`, `width` and `frame_count` load as integers, matching their
  documented type; a fractional value is reported instead of stored.
- Unknown or conflicting location and depth codes are reported as finding
  `normalization_warnings` and load issues whether or not `source_keys` are
  supplied. Previously they were silently dropped without source keys.
  `FindingNormalizationEvidence` and `FindingNormalizationWarning` accept
  `source=None`.
