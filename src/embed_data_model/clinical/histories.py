"""Patient-reported history: prior exposures and prior procedures.

History rows are reported or previously documented facts, not treatments or
procedures performed at the associated exam. A row without an explicit
``record_id`` is one fact in a snapshot of the patient's history; its source
location is evidence and never becomes an event identity. Observations are
stored on their Patient and do not repeat the patient ID.
